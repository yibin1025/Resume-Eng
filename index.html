							As a senior engineer, he is responsible for the development of Industrial Internet of Things
							(IIoT) platforms and
							Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), including the following:
						</div>
						<div>
							<br />
							<ul>
								<li>The primary function of the Industrial IoT platform is to integrate various
									communication protocols,including common Modbus RTU/UDP, Modbus TCP, and RS232/485,
									for the real-time data
									collection of machines,and using edge computing to reduce the loading on the data
									center.To enable other systems to utilize those data, using the publish/subscribe
									feature
									of MQTT to build a proxy server for data collection and integration from various
									communication protocols and publish it, and other systems could obtain the real-time
									data related to machines via the MQTT subscription.
								</li>
								<li>Taking over WMS project left by the previous engineer and continuously optimizing
									them, including the following:
									<ul>
										<li>Using RedLock.net with Redis to implement distributed locking to ensure only
											one request each time the database accesses the API, and avoiding the data
											dirty reads caused by high concurrent requests.</li>
										<li>Adding indexes on data tables, and optimizing LINQ/Lambda Expressions, to
											shorten the response time for large data queries.
											Regularly updating infrequently modified data to memory or Redis for
											reducing the system's frequent reading of large amounts of data from the
											database and enhancing the response effectivity of data queries.</li>
										<li>Retrieving large data from ERP, using bulk insert/update to batch
											insert/update data into the database for reducing database response time,
											and avoiding the failure of other system functions due to the database being
											locked for a long time.</li>

							The finance module was microservice-based development, which provided RESTful APIs to the
							front-end, and RESTful APIs were developed via the Web API of .NET Core. Used the Repository
							Pattern in the Model tier of MVC to detach the dependence of the Model on the data access,
							and realized the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
							MySQL was the main database for the finance module, and accessed database via light ORM

						</div>
						<div><br></div>
						<div>
							In order to respond to high concurrency queries during disaster periods, retrieve the
