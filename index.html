						    The finance module was microservice-based development, which provided RESTful APIs to the front-end, and RESTful APIs were developed via the Web API of .NET Core. Used the Repository Pattern in the Model tier of MVC to detach the dependence of the Model on the data access, and realized the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

						   <div>
						     To respond to the high concurrency of online transactions, used the RedLock.net to realize distributed locks to meet ACID policy. To achieve low latency of response, the historical data were stored in Redis; In other words, retrieved the historical data from Redis could reduce response time.

						    Headed the team to develop a workflow engine as a SaaS Software and a microservice for in-house of private cloud. This microservice defined the workflows via XML Files, and the RESTful APIs were developed by the Web API of .NET Core 2.0 and provided to the in-house system to integrate into its system. In order to avoid lots of code refactoring when database change was occurring, using the Repository Pattern in the Model tier of MVC to detach the dependence of the Model on the data access, and realized the Dependency inversion principle (DIP) of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Related technologies were C#, .NET Core 2.0, LINQ, SQL Server, Web API, ActiveMQ, Docker.

						    Headed the team to refactor and maintain the Smart Component DPPM System. The System had multiple data sources and large data operations, in order to improve data accessing efficiency, add the indexes in required schemes and used asynchronous technologies to retrieved data from multiple sources at the same time, and stored the common and historical data to Redis for the catch and archived the low latency. In order to reduce the access time of large amounts of data inserting, SqlBulkCopy was the best solution. Related technologies were C#, ASP.NET MVC, LINQ, WCF to RESTful API, SQL Server, Oracle, and Redis.

						  <div>
						    In order to respond to high concurrency queries during disaster periods, retrieve the real-time data of water stations and rain stations from the database per 10 seconds and stored them temporarily to memories on the Server via Memory Catch technology to avoid large amounts queries from the database at the same time to achieve low latency.
